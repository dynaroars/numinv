Detailed instructions for setting up the tool are forthcoming (essentially we will need SAGE, KLEE, and Z3).
DIG2 is written in Python (the .py src code are in the main directory).
Benchmarks are in subdirectory "programs"  (nla, complexity, and hola)
Results are in "fse17_results".  These are logs, which we use collect_results.py to extract stats such as mean #'s of invs, time, etc
